                <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
                posted by BGB, November 15, 2016
                <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking
                    technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i>
                    cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a
                    water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the
                    food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff
                    Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
                <p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill
                        Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before
                    <time datetime="20161130">November 30</time>.
                </p>
                Location: Bakerâ€™s Corner, Seekonk, MA
                Hours: Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to 11pm
